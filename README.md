# projectManager
ProjectManager is project planning software. 
It allows users to create new projects, break them down into tasks, set deadlines, add files, and more. 
I am not a professional programmer, and this is my first program in C++. Before this, I had never programmed in C or C++, but I have some experience in Java. So, please be forgiving if the code is not perfect. :-)
However, it works correctly, and I consistently make changes to improve its stylistic aspects.

## how it works
